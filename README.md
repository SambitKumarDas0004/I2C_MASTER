# I2C_MASTER
Master block of an I2C bus 

This project implements an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) Master Controller, designed in 
Verilog HDL and taken through a complete RTL-to-GDS physical design flow. The design follows
the I2C protocol specification, supporting address transmission, data transfer, acknowledgment
handling, repeated start, and stop conditions using open-drain SDA and SCL lines.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate protocol-aware RTL design, finite state machine (FSM)
implementation, clock-domain handling, and ASIC physical design best practices using industry-standard EDA tools.
